# Measuring the Progress of AI Research

This repository contains a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), which you
can see live at [https://eff.org/ai/metrics](https://www.eff.org/ai/metrics).
It collects problems and metrics / datasets from the artificial intelligence
and machine learning research literature, and tracks progress on them. You can
use it to see how things are progressing in specific subfields or AI/ML as a
whole, as a place to report new results you've obtained, and as place to look
for problems that might benefit from having new datasets/metrics designed for
them, or as a source to build on for data science projects.

At EFF we're also interested in collecting this data to understand the likely
implications of AI, but to begin with we're focused on gathering it.
